=rdbs= (RekorDBox to Spotify) is a tool for putting Rekordbox
playlists into Spotify.

* Installation

  #+begin_src shell
    go install github.com/r-medina/rdbs
  #+end_src

* How to use

  1. get your spotify api keys

     https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/

     you need a Spotify ID and a Spotify Secret

     put them into the environment as =SPOTIFY_ID= and =SPOTIFY_SECRET=

  3. export a Rekordbox playlist to a =.txt= file

     - right click the playlist and click "Export a playlist to a
       file" â†’ "Export a playlist to a file for KUVO (*.txt)"

  4. use this program

     #+begin_src shell
       rdbs <your-playlist-name> <location-of-exported-plylist-txt-file>
     #+end_src

     running this will open a browser which will grant this app
     permissions to make playlists and search for songs on your behalf

     after you've authorized it, it will make a playlist with the
     tracks in the file and log the names of any tracks it didn't find
